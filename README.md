# Quantum-Morphic Fields Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Quantum-Morphic Fields Project repository. This interdisciplinary initiative seeks to bridge quantum mechanics with the theoretical concept of morphic fields as proposed by [Rupert Sheldrake](https://www.sheldrake.org/research), aiming to explore and experimentally validate the interaction between these domains.

## Introduction
Morphic fields, a concept extensively researched by [Rupert Sheldrake](https://www.sheldrake.org/research), suggest the presence of fields that both influence and are influenced by living organisms. This project attempts to understand and validate these fields through the lens of quantum mechanics, using both theoretical models and experimental approaches. Key influences on this work include Sheldrake's theories on [morphic resonance](https://www.sheldrake.org/research/morphic-resonance) and [form from sound](https://www.sheldrake.org/research/form-from-sound).

## Project Components

### Simulation of Biological Adaptation
We design and simulate quantum circuits that mimic biological adaptation, testing if quantum systems can develop behaviors similar to biological systems' adaptations to environmental pressures.

### Non-local Influence Tests
Experiments with entangled quantum systems are conducted to observe potential non-local influences, aiming to find quantum equivalents to morphic resonance.

### Cross-Disciplinary Experiments
This component involves collaborations between quantum physicists and biologists to create experiments where quantum systems interact with biological systems, investigating potential influences between the two.

### Longitudinal Quantum Memory Experiments
Our experiments study the memory capabilities of quantum systems, exploring how they learn and relearn tasks, and whether they show signs of cumulative memory, akin to morphic fields.

### Quantum Networking
Using a network of quantum computers, we examine system-wide responses to local changes, testing theories of morphic fields at a larger scale.

## Methodology
Our methodology incorporates the use of [IBM Quantum](https://quantum.ibm.com/) and Jupyter Notebooks, facilitating a blend of theoretical simulation and practical experimentation. Each component's specific methodologies are detailed in their respective directories within this repository.
