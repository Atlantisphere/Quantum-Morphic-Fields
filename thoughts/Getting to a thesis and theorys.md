The thesis I’m aiming to arrive at:
An a-relativistic unified morphic field theory.

Current Speculations:
- Nothing spooky Is happening and distance is space is not relative within the quantum world.
- I speculate that the Quantium environment exists in a single dimension and there is no distance.
- I think we can unify theories.
- The C2 within E=MC2 could be be a set rather than fully defined.

Papers to write for peer review:
“Setting a framework for experimentation, coupling together theories by way of Non-Relativistic Quantum Computing and Relativistic Analogue Computing.”

Skills needed to get to a useful thesis:
- Calculus
	This is the programming language of science, I can only hope to articulate my thoughts through this to convey them.
- Set Theory (understanding)
	This, is worth understanding as it could be a key part of unifying fields, it is also worth understanding more.
